This is the mime-construct distribution.  mime-construct constructs and
(by default) mails MIME messages.  It is entirely driven from the command
line, it is designed to be used by other programs, or people who act like
programs.

The change log is in debian/changelog.  Other than this you'll probably
want to ignore the contents of the debian subdirectory, it contains the
files which turn the distribution into a Debian package.

The program can be installed in the usual manner:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make install
